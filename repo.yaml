    \ instantly pop in to talk without having to call.\n- Get a community of any size\

  description: 'Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local
    folder of plain text Markdown files. In Obsidian, making and following connections
    is frictionless, and with the connections in place, you can explore all of your
    knowledge in the interactive graph view. Obsidian supports CommonMark and GitHub
    Flavored Markdown (GFM), along with other useful notetaking features such as tags,
    LaTeX mathematical expressions, mermaid diagrams, footnotes, internal links and
    embedding Obsidian notes or external files. Obsidian also has a plugin system
    with 20+ supported plugins to expand its capabilities.


    The documentation can be accessed by opening the demo vault that is shipped in
    Obsidian.


    Obsidian will always remain free for personal use, no account or license is required
    for qualifying use cases described in the End User License Agreement. However,
    commercial users should purchase a license on Obsidian''s website. Users also
    have the option to purchase a Catalyst license to get early access to insider
    builds and support the development. Additionally, Obsidian offers an optional
    paid hosting service for your notes. Details about this optional hosting service
    can be found on the Obsidian website.


    This distribution is verified by the Obsidian team but isn''t supported


    Wayland support can enabled with --socket=wayland in Flatseal which can enable
    features like pinch zoom


    GPU acceleration can be disabled if necessary by setting OBSIDIAN_DISABLE_GPU=1
    in Flatseal


    Pdflatex support in pandoc currently requires installing the org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.texlive
    SDK


    Note: Regular users should disable "Automatic Updates" within Obsidian as public
    release updates are handled by Flatpak itself. Insiders should keep this enabled
    to receive insider builds, as those will not be made available on Flathub.


    This flatpak goes into great lengths to provide a nice experience for end users.
    In order for the Git plugin to work it requires permission to the ssh-auth socket
    (--socket=ssh-auth). It also exposes the home directory in the sandbox (required
    for Drag and Drop operations). If you don''t use the Git plugin you can disable
    the ssh-auth socket permission, e.g. using Flatseal. You can also remove access
    to the home directory if you want and the flatpak will continue to work, albeit
    with reduced functionality. In case you do remove access to the homedir, note
    that in order for things to not break for the Git plugin, --persist=.ssh flag
    has been passed and a bind mount to ~/.var/app/md.obsidian.Obsidian/ is created
    by flatpak, allowing that location to be used for persistent data (but your home
    directory''s .ssh remains unaccessible)'
