    \ instantly pop in to talk without having to call.\n- Get a community of any size\

  description: 'Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local
    folder of plain text Markdown files. In Obsidian, making and following connections
    is frictionless, and with the connections in place, you can explore all of your
    knowledge in the interactive graph view. Obsidian supports CommonMark and GitHub
    Flavored Markdown (GFM), along with other useful notetaking features such as tags,
    LaTeX mathematical expressions, mermaid diagrams, footnotes, internal links and
    embedding Obsidian notes or external files. Obsidian also has a plugin system
    with 20+ supported plugins to expand its capabilities.


    The documentation can be accessed by opening the demo vault that is shipped in
    Obsidian.


    Obsidian will always remain free for personal use, no account or license is required
    for qualifying use cases described in the End User License Agreement. However,
    commercial users should purchase a license on Obsidian''s website. Users also
    have the option to purchase a Catalyst license to get early access to insider
    builds and support the development. Additionally, Obsidian offers an optional
    paid hosting service for your notes. Details about this optional hosting service
    can be found on the Obsidian website.


    This distribution is verified by the Obsidian team but isn''t supported


    Wayland support can enabled with --socket=wayland in Flatseal which can enable
    features like pinch zoom


    GPU acceleration can be disabled if necessary by setting OBSIDIAN_DISABLE_GPU=1
    in Flatseal


    Pdflatex support in pandoc currently requires installing the org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.texlive
    SDK


    Note: Regular users should disable "Automatic Updates" within Obsidian as public
    release updates are handled by Flatpak itself. Insiders should keep this enabled
    to receive insider builds, as those will not be made available on Flathub.


    This flatpak goes into great lengths to provide a nice experience for end users.
    In order for the Git plugin to work it requires permission to the ssh-auth socket
    (--socket=ssh-auth). It also exposes the home directory in the sandbox (required
    for Drag and Drop operations). If you don''t use the Git plugin you can disable
    the ssh-auth socket permission, e.g. using Flatseal. You can also remove access
    to the home directory if you want and the flatpak will continue to work, albeit
    with reduced functionality. In case you do remove access to the homedir, note
    that in order for things to not break for the Git plugin, --persist=.ssh flag
    has been passed and a bind mount to ~/.var/app/md.obsidian.Obsidian/ is created
    by flatpak, allowing that location to be used for persistent data (but your home
    directory''s .ssh remains unaccessible)'

    - Automatically updating (while preserving your bookmarks and preferences)

  description: "Ungoogled Chromium is Google Chromium, sans dependency on Google web\
    \ services. It also\n      features some tweaks to enhance privacy, control, and\
    \ transparency (almost all of which\n      require manual activation or enabling).\n\
    \nUngoogled Chromium retains the default Chromium experience as closely as possible.\
    \ Unlike\n      other Chromium forks that have their own visions of a web browser,\
    \ Ungoogled Chromium is\n      essentially a drop-in replacement for Chromium.\n\
    \nWithout signing in to a Google Account, Chromium does pretty well in terms of\
    \ security and\n      privacy. However, Chromium still has some dependency on\
    \ Google web services and binaries. In\n      addition, Google designed Chromium\
    \ to be easy and intuitive for users, which means they\n      compromise on transparency\
    \ and control of inner operations.\n\nUngoogled Chromium addresses these issues\
    \ in the following ways:\n- Remove all remaining background requests to any web\
    \ services while building and running\n        the browser\n- Remove all code\
    \ specific to Google web services\n- Remove all uses of pre-made binaries from\
    \ the source code, and replace them with\n        user-provided alternatives when\
    \ possible\n- Disable features that inhibit control and transparency, and add\
    \ or modify features that\n        promote them (these changes will almost always\
    \ require manual activation or enabling)\n\nThese features are implemented as\
    \ configuration flags, patches, and custom scripts."

    Because Easy Effects uses the default PipeWire sound server it will work with
    most, if not all, applications you use. All supported applications are presented
    in the main window, where each can be enabled individually.


    Besides manipulating sound output, Easy Effects is able to apply effects to an
    input device, such as a microphone. This is, for example, useful in audio recording,
    but it also works well during voice conversations.


    When Easy Effects is launched it will conveniently remember the configuration
    used in the last session. It is also possible to save all the current settings
    as profiles.'

  description: 'FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to
    design real-life objects of any size. Parametric modeling allows you to easily
    modify your design by going back into your model history and changing its parameters.
    It is designed to fit a wide range of uses including product design, mechanical
    engineering, architecture and 3D printing.


    FreeCAD allows you to sketch geometry constrained 2D shapes and use them as a
    base to build other objects. It contains many components to adjust dimensions
    or extract design details from 3D models to create high quality production-ready
    drawings. it is a multiplatfom (Windows, Mac and Linux), highly customizable using
    the Python language. It reads and writes to many open file formats such as STEP,
    IGES, STL, SVG, DXF, OBJ, IFC, DAE and many others, making it possible to seamlessly
    integrate it into your workflow.


    FreeCAD includes a modern Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tools, experimental CFD,
    BIM, Geodata workbenches, a Path (CNC) workbench, a robot simulation module that
    allows you to study robot movements and many more, and a rich collection of plugins
    and macros installable directly from within the application.'

  description: "MAME's purpose is to preserve decades of software history. As electronic\
    \ technology continues to rush\n        forward, MAME prevents this important\
    \ \"vintage\" software from being lost and forgotten. This is\n        achieved\
    \ by documenting the hardware and how it functions. The source code to MAME serves\
    \ as this documentation.\n        The fact that the software is usable serves\
    \ primarily to validate the accuracy of the documentation (how else\n        can\
    \ you prove that you have recreated the hardware faithfully?). Over time, MAME\
    \ (originally stood for Multiple\n        Arcade Machine Emulator) absorbed the\
    \ sister-project MESS (Multi Emulator Super System), so MAME now documents a\n\
    \        wide variety of (mostly vintage) computers, video game consoles and calculators,\
    \ in addition to the arcade video\n        games that were its initial focus."
